# Now it's your turn.

# Note that the exercise will be (a little) less challenging than the example.

#1. Write a function that takes a list of words 
#2. returns words that are longer than 10 characters 
#3. but don't contain a hyphen. 
#4. If longer than 15 characters, shorten to 15 characters and have an ellipsis (...) on end.

#hyphen is a dash -

# For example, if the input is:
# [
#   'hello',
#   'nonbiological',
#   'Kay',
#   'this-is-a-long-word',
#   'antidisestablishmentarianism'
# ]
# then the output should be:
# "These words are quite long: nonbiological, antidisestablis..."

# @TASK: Complete this exercise.

print("")
print("Function: report_long_words")
